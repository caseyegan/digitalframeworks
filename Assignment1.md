### Causes of death are changing for Americans 

I read a [story](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-americans-are-dying-from-suicide-drug-use-and-diarrhea/) from FiveThirtyEight that uses data to discuss how Americans are dying in different ways than they used to. Among the changes, more Americans are dying of suicide, substance abuse and diarrhea.  

The data was used in a couple different ways. The two big ways it was used was to show disparities in causes of death across regions of the country. Multiple maps were created to show deaths per 100,000 people by county. In some counties, where a type of death was particularly common, the county was really dark. In other counties, where it was much less common, the county appeared much lighter.A legend at the bottom of the maps shows how many deaths per 100,000 people corrolates to a certain color. While those maps showed a specific year, another map showed the change over time across the country for lower respiratory deaths between 1980 and 2014. 

In all, maps were created to show various death rates across the country for the following diseases: 

1. Lower respiratory diseases 
2. Diarrheal diseases 
3. Alcohol use disorders 
4. Drug use disorders.
