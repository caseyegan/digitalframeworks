In pouring through the data, I found something interesting: Four Republican members of Congress have spent money from their own re-election coffers at President Donald Trump's D.C. hotel property and then subsequently announced they are retiring from Congress. 

The pattern from the four is astoundingly similar: They spent money at a Trump-owned property in 2017 and in 2018, they announced their retirements from Congress. 

On April 7, 2017, the political re-election committee for Republican Rep. Bill Shuster, who represents Pennsylvania's ninth district, spent $6,037 at Trump International Hotel in D.C. In January of 2018, Shuster announced he is retiring from office and not seeking re-election. 

On December 11, 2017, the political re-election committee for Republican Rep. Gregg Harper, who represents Mississippi's third district, spent $1,696 at the Trump International Hotel in D.C. Like Shuster, Harper announced in January of 2018, that he will not be seeking re-election and is retiring from office. 

On January 03, 2017, the political re-election committee for Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee spent $1051 at the Trump International Hotel in D.C. Following a similar pattern, Corker announced in September of 2017 that he is retiring from office and not seeking re-election. 

Finally, on September 01, 2017, the political re-election committee for Republican Rep. Tom Rooney, who represents Florida's 17th district, spent $352 at Trump's Chicago hotel.
