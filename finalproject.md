# Despite frustrations, Metro still faster on weekends for a popular journey

The Washington subway system can be a hassle on the weekends. Scaled back service and construction projects can elicit infuriating wait times, continuous delays, and even drive some to ponder the question of whether it’s faster to just walk.  So, I set out to answer just that. 

After one particularly maddening experience last month, one in which I waited nearly 25 minutes for what locals refer to as the “Metro,” I decided to determine if this was empirically true for a trip to a popular, central destination in the city from my apartment.  

My residence in Washington’s Dupont Circle neighborhood sits 1.7 miles from Capital One Arena, a multi-purpose sports and music venue that hosts professional basketball, hockey, and music events, among others in the city’s Chinatown district. On average, the complex hosts around 220 events a year, according to its website. So, the question is: Is it faster for me to just walk to the arena on weekends than take the Metro?

On fourteen occasions over the course of three weekends in May – six different weekend days in all– I checked the data to compare the journey times. Estimates were assessed at all times of the day over the three weeks. 

Google Maps tells me that from my apartment it’s a 35-minute walk to the arena if I take the most efficient route. It’s a walk that I have done myself on many occasions and can confirm the Google Maps estimates. For the purposes of this study, however, I did check the estimates on the app at each of the fourteen times to confirm. 

To determine the most accurate time estimate for the Metro trip, I used a combination of sources to determine the trip time. From where I live to the Dupont Circle Metro station is a 10-minute walk according to Google Maps. I have done this walk on a number of occasions, and it almost always comes out to exactly 10 minutes. At the Gallery Place-Chinatown Metro station, there are a number of different exits, but even for the exit that opens right next to the entrance to Capital One Arena, there is some transportation time that is not instantaneous. So, I determined that to be a one-minute walk, which Google Maps confirmed. Both Google Maps and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), the agency that runs the Metro, estimate that once on the train, it’s an 8-minute journey from Dupont Circle to the Gallery Place-Chinatown station. Nineteen minutes of the commute estimate is fixed in. 

The final element of the puzzle is the wait time for the Metro. For that, I sourced wait times from WMATA’s “next train” function on its website. So, if it said that a train was twenty minutes away when I was leaving my apartment, I would subtract 10 minutes from that estimate to incorporate the fixed walking time estimate and add the remainder onto the predetermined 19-minute estimate. 

So, just what did I find? On average, it is discernably faster to take the Metro than to walk. In fact, it’s nearly seven minutes faster on average. My research found an average walking estimate of 35 minutes and four seconds from my apartment to the arena. For taking the Metro, my study found an average trip time estimate of 28 minutes and 16 seconds.

There were some variations, however, as to when it was most efficient to take the Metro. The four fastest estimates were all recorded before 1 p.m. 

The other variable is the difference between Saturday and Sunday. Only three of my 14 trip times were assessed on Saturday. The data from Saturday was not noticeably different than the averages from my Sunday estimates. However, my longest train estimate did come on a Saturday morning, with my lone 35-minute trip time coming at 11 a.m. on a Saturday, which is inconsistent with the trend that I found about morning trips being faster. 

On the contrary, however, I also calculated a 24-minute trip at 11:30 am on a Saturday, which was my third fastest trip estimate. 

Unsurprisingly, there wasn’t a ton of variation in my walking approximations. However, on one occasion, there was a 36-minute estimate due to road closures. This was the only variant in my walking research. Every other inquiry turned up a 35-minute estimation.  

When it came to train trip research, however, the estimates came up in a range of times spanning from 19 minutes to 35 minutes. 

While it was noticeably faster to take the Metro in the morning, it was also objectively slower the later it got in the evening, with the majority of the slowest trips coming towards the end of the day. Three of the five latest estimates came out to 33 minutes each, all of which tied for the second slowest approximations.

And while it was clearly quicker to take the Metro, on average, the wide range of estimates (19-35 minutes) means that the times are worth investigating, instead of instinctively taking the train by default. 

On the efficient end of the spectrum, the Metro can be nearly half the trip time of walking, which would imply that it would make one’s decision of whether to walk or take the train simple. However, with the other end of the spectrum of the Metro estimate being 35 minutes – the same amount of time as it takes to walk – it makes the decision worth looking into on each occasion.  

The other element of the decision of which mode of transportation to take really comes down to my mood. If I check comparative trip times and walking is 35 minutes and the train is 30 minutes, I may opt to walk to enjoy a nice day outside rather than deal with the hustle and bustle of a crowded and sometimes overheated Metro ride.

So while I’ve answered my question technically, I will continue to be checking times for both each time I make the trek, because as I’ve learned throughout this journey, the numbers can be all over the map.
