This dataset does not include all competitive senate races in the 2018 midterms, just five competitive races identified and polled by Morning Consult, a technology and media company that produces popular surveys and polls. I think that a few data points here deserve some emphasis. For starters, at 38 percent, Republican Senator Dean Heller has the lowest approval rating of all five people represented in this data. I find that interesting, considering that polling suggests a Democratic "blue wave" of sorts in this year's midterm elections. Another data point worthy of emphasis is Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown's approval rating. With a net approval rating of +16, Brown has by far the highest net approval rating of anyone featured in this data. Additionally, at 45 percent, Brown also has the highest approval rating of anyone featured in the data. I find that surprising considering Ohio's recent turn to the right, voting for President Donald Trump by 8 percentage points in the 2016 election. 

I also found it interesting that Democratic Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania had a net approval rating of +8 points, the second highest of the five senators featured. This is worthy of emphasis - in my opinion - because, like Ohio, Pennsylvania is one of those "Rust Belt" states that is trending more conservative. The state voted for Trump in the 2016 election. In general, the positive numbers for Democrats like Brown and Casey are surprising and worthy of emphasis to me not only because they are Democrats in Rust Belt states, but also because they are "incumbents" who have been around for multiple terms. 

This data is trustworthy because it was compiled by Morning Consult, which is a trusted polling organization with a reputable track record and is regularly cited in the media. According to Morning Consult, the data is from over 275,000 surveys conducted with registered voters from across the country. Additionally, it says that data was weighted to approximate a target sample of registered voters that incorporates a number of factors, such as age, race, and gender, among others.
