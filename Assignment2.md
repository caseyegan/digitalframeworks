# Data Question

 ### Editor, 

I hope this finds you well. I'd really like to write a story that uses data to answer the following question: How much did the population of King County, Washington (the county where Seattle is) grow by in the last measurable year? 

I believe I can credibly answer this question for a number of reasons. The answer, according to the U.S. Census is 32, 687. I trust this data for a range of different reasons. 

The source of this information is the population division of the U.S. Census, an objective, government-run bureau that produces the gold standard for population estimates. The estimates reflect the bureaus estimates of change between July 1, 2016, and July 1, 2017. Since we are only in April of 2018, this is the most up-to-date data we have on this topic.  

The estimates are projections based on the 2010 Census report, the most recent of the bureau's decennial report. The bureau's population division provides updated annual estimates for the country, states, counties, and Puerto Rico.  

The Census provides that its estimates are based on a complex equation that takes the population base of a region, adds the new birth totals, subtracts deaths, and adds new migration figures.  

This estimates are deemed credible by a number of state and private organizations. According to the Census, they are used for a number of different purposes, such as federal funding allocations, business planning, and community development.  

Because the Census provides a value for total population change, it does provide a data point and direct answer to my question. 

Since I am only looking for a single data value and the Census provided it, it doesn't appear that I need to locate any additional information, or that any information is missing.  

As presented, the data uses the methodology described by the Census and uses the equation it provides to arrive at the value. 

While the Census, doesn't allow a link to a specific data set, [here](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/2010-2017/2017-natstcopr-meth.pdf) is a link to the methodology. 

Best,
