##Republicans Who Appear on Bill Maher 

Bill Maher's "Real Time" show is a left-leaning program that features vigorous debate with guests from across the political spectrum. Throughout the Trump administration, I've read and heard about how one of the problems with the political divide in America is that people consume media in silos, resorting to media consumption that aligns with their ideology, never hearing the perspective of the other side. I want to know how many Republican elected officials have appeared on Bill Maher's show since President Donald Trump took the oath of office in 2017. I want to see how that number stacks up against the number of Democratic elected officials Maher has had on in the same time period. This could be an interesting story because if Maher has a relatively similar number of officials from both parties, it would buck that narrative. However, if Maher has had many more Democratic officials than Republican ones, it would serve as a good example and case study of this divide. I also want to know if the Republicans who appear are members of Congress, or state officials. This will give me an indication about the types of Republicans that are willing to come on the show to discuss the Trump administration.  
In my dataset, I will collect the following information from publicly available guest lists from the show: 

1. The number of Democratic elected officials who have appeared on the show since Trump took office. For each official who has appeared, I will include their name and title.

2. The number of Republican elected officials who have appeared on the show since Trump took office. For each official who has appeared, I will include their name and title.

3. If they are Republican, are they a state official or member of Congress? 

4. A tally breaking down the number of Republican members of Congress who have appeared on the show since Trump took office.
